# veld_code__downloader

A very simple curl call. Since many veld chains need to download data, it makes sense to encapsulate
the download functionality into a dedicated downloader veld code.

## usage

Set configs directly in the [veld.yaml](veld.yaml) or integrate into a chain veld.

Run with 
```
docker compose -f veld.yaml up
```

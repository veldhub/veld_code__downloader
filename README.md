# veld_code__downloader
    
A download helper, for simple or batch downloads, also offers automatic archival extraction. Since
many veld chains need to download data, it makes sense to encapsulate the download functionality
into a dedicated downloader code veld.

For examples, see: https://github.com/veldhub/veld_chain__demo_downloader

## usage

Set configs directly in the [veld.yaml](veld.yaml) or integrate into a chain veld.

Run with 
```
docker compose -f veld.yaml up
```
